##  Growth - Measuring Cost

### For which of these procedures does the worst-case running time scale linearly in the number of elements in the input list p? (You may assume that the elements in the list are all small numbers)


- (a) **sum_list**

    ```python
    def sum_list(p):
        sum = 0
        for e in p:
            sum = sum + e
        return sum
    ```

- (b) **has_duplicate_element**

    ```python
    def has_duplicate_element(p):
       res = []
       for i in range(0, len(p)):
           for j in range(0, len(p)):
               if i != j and p[i] == p[j]:
                   return True
       return False
    ```

- (c) **mystery**

    ```python
    def mystery(p):
       i = 0
       while True:
           if i >= len(p):
               break
           if p[i] % 2:
               i = i + 2
           else:
               i = i + 1
       return i
    ```

**Answer:** (a) & (c)


## Hash String

### Suppose we have a hash table implemented as described in Unit 5 using the `hash_string` function. Which of the following are true statements?


- (a) The number of string comparisons done to lookup a keyword that is not a key in the hash table may be less than the number needed to lookup a keyword that is a key in the hash table.

- (b) We should expect the time to lookup most keywords in the hash table will decrease as we increase the number of buckets.

- (c) It is always better to have more buckets in a hash table.

- (d) The time to lookup a keyword in the hash table is always less than the time it would take in a linear time list (as used in Unit 4).

**Answer:** (a), (b)


## Is Offered - Dictionaries of Dictionaries (of Dictionaries)

### The next several questions concern the data structure below for keeping  track of Udacity's courses (where all of the values are strings):

```  
    { <hexamester>, { <class>: { <property>: <value>, ... },
                                     ... },
      ... }
```

### For the following questions, you will find the

```
        for <key> in <dictionary>:
                   <block>
```

### construct useful.  This loops through the key values in the Dictionary.  For example, this procedure returns a list of all the courses offered in the given hexamester:

```python
def courses_offered(courses, hexamester):
    res = []
    for c in courses[hexamester]:
        res.append(c)
    return res
```

### Define a procedure, `is_offered(courses, course, hexamester)`, that returns `True` if the input course is offered in the input hexamester, and returns `False` otherwise.  For example,

                           'assistant': 'Peter C.',
                           'prereq': 'cs101'},

def is_offered(courses, course, hexamester):

print is_offered(courses, 'cs101', 'apr2012') # True

```


## When Offered

### Define a procedure, `when_offered(courses, course)`, that takes as a courses data structure and a string representing a class, and returns a list of strings representing the hexamesters when the input course is offered.

#### Solution
____________________

```python
#print when_offered (courses, 'cs101') # ['apr2012', 'feb2012']
#print when_offered(courses, 'bio893') # []

def when_offered(courses, course):
    res = []
    for sem in courses:
        get = courses_offered(courses, sem)
        if course in get:
            res.append(sem)
    return res
```

## Involved

#### [Double Gold Star] 

### Define a procedure, `involved(courses, person)`, that takes as input a courses structure and a person and returns a Dictionary that describes all the courses the person is involved in.  A person is involved in a course if they are a value for any property for the course.  The output Dictionary should have hexamesters as its keys, and each value should be a list of courses that are offered that hexamester (the courses in the list can be in any order).

#### Solution
____________________

```python
def involved(courses, person):
    res = {}
    for sem in courses:
        get = courses_offered(courses, sem)
        rez = []
        for course in get:
            data = courses[sem][course]
            for i in data:
                if data[i] == person:
                    rez.append(course)
        if len(rez) > 0:
            res[sem] = rez
    return res

print involved(courses, 'Dave') # {'apr2012': ['cs101', 'cs387'], 'feb2012': ['cs101']}
print involved(courses, 'Peter C.') # {'apr2012': ['cs262'], 'feb2012': ['cs101']}
print involved(courses, 'Dorina') # {'jan2044': ['cs001']}
```

## Refactoring


### In video 28. Update, it was suggested that some of the duplicate code in lookup and update could be avoided by a better design.  We can do this by defining a procedure that finds the entry corresponding to a given key, and using that in both lookup and update.

### Here are the original procedures:

```python
def hashtable_update(htable, key, value):
    bucket = hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key)
    for entry in bucket:
        if entry[0] == key:
            entry[1] = value
            return
    bucket.append([key, value])

def hashtable_lookup(htable, key):
    bucket = hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key)
    for entry in bucket:
        if entry[0] == key:
            return entry[1]
    return None

def make_hashtable(size):
    table = []
    for unused in range(0, size):
        table.append([])
    return table

def hash_string(s, size):
    h = 0
    for c in s:
         h = h + ord(c)
    return h % size

def hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key):
    return htable[hash_string(key, len(htable))]
```

### Whenever we have duplicate code like the loop that finds the entry in `hashtable_update` and `hashtable_lookup`, we should think if there is a better way to write this that would avoid the duplication.  We should be able to rewrite these procedures to be shorter by defining a new procedure and rewriting both `hashtable_update` and `hashtable_lookup` to use that procedure.

### Modify the code for both `hashtable_update` and `hashtable_lookup` to have the same behavior they have now, but using fewer lines of code in each procedure.  You should define a new procedure to help with this.  Your new version should have approximately the same running time as the original version, but neither `hashtable_update` or `hashtable_lookup` should include any for or while loop, and the block of each procedure should be no more than 6 lines long.

#### Solution
____________________

```python
def iterr(bucket, key):
    i = 0
    for entry in bucket:
        if entry[0] == key:
            return i
        i += 1
    return -1

def hashtable_update(htable, key, value):
    bucket = hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key)
    idx = iterr(bucket, key)
    if idx is not -1:
        bucket[idx][1] = value
    else:
        bucket.append([key, value])

def hashtable_lookup(htable, key):
    bucket = hashtable_get_bucket(htable, key)
    idx = iterr(bucket, key)
    if idx is not -1:
        return bucket[idx][1]
    else:
        return None

table = make_hashtable(10)
hashtable_update(table, 'Python', 'Monty')
hashtable_update(table, 'CLU', 'Barbara Liskov')
hashtable_update(table, 'JavaScript', 'Brendan Eich')
hashtable_update(table, 'Python', 'Guido van Rossum')
print hashtable_lookup(table, 'Python') # => Guido van Rossum
```


## Memoization

#### [Double Gold Star] 

### Memoization is a way to make code run faster by saving previously computed results. Instead of needing to recompute the value of an expression, a memoized computation first looks for the value in a cache of pre-computed values.

### Define a procedure, `cached_execution(cache, code)`, that takes in two inputs: a cache, which is a Dictionary that maps strings representing Python expressions to their previously computed values, and code, a string that is a Python expression.  Your procedure should return the value of code, but should only evaluate code if it has not been previously evaluated.


### Here is an example showing the desired behavior of `cached_execution`:

```python
def factorial(n):
    print "Running factorial"
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i
    return result

cache = {} # start cache as an empty dictionary
# first execution (should print out Running factorial and the result)
print cached_execution(cache, 'factorial(50)')                           

print "Second time:"
# second execution (should only print out the result)
print cached_execution(cache, 'factorial(50)')
```

### Here is a more interesting example using cached_execution  (do not worry if you do not understand this, though,  it will be more clear after Unit 6):

```python
def cached_fibo(cache, n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return n
    else:
        return cached_execution(cache, 'cached_fibo(cache, ' + str(n - 1) + ')') \
               + cached_execution(cache, 'cached_fibo(cache, ' + str(n - 2) + ')')
```

### Hint: you will need to use the built-in eval function similarly to how we used it in time_execution.  The eval function takes a string as input, and returns the result of evaluating that string as a Python expression.


#### Solution
____________________

```python
cache = {}

def cached_execution(cache, code):
    if code in cache:
        return cache[code]
    cache[code] = eval(code)
    return cache[code]
```
